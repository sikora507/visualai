        <h1>A journey to ES-HyperNEAT LSTM networks</h1>
        <p>On the left side, there are next steps / building blocks to complete Evolvable Substrate Hypercube based Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies with recurrent 
        neural network with Long Short Term Memory</p>
        <p>Starting from generating simple activation functions that are bilding blocks of neurons, we will go through next steps and create more and more complex structures.</p>
        <p>This application runs on <strong>.NET Core</strong> on backend and <strong>Vue.js</strong> on frontend along with webpack for building client side resources.</p>
